# Hotel Booking Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze a comprehensive dataset of hotel bookings for both a city hotel and a resort hotel. By examining various aspects of the booking data, we seek to uncover key trends and patterns in the hospitality industry.

## Dataset Description
This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things.

## Key Findings

### Hotel Type and Seasonal Trends
- **Hotel Type Booking Ratios:** City hotels account for 58.9% of total bookings, while resort hotels make up 41.1%.
- **Seasonal Booking Trends:** The peak booking season is identified as July and August, as measured by the highest number of bookings.

### Cancellation Patterns and Market Segments
- **Lead Time and Cancellation Correlation:** Bookings that were not canceled typically have a shorter lead time than those that were canceled.
- **Median Lead Time Analysis:** The median lead time for the non-canceled group is significantly lower than the canceled group (38 days compared to 80 days).
- **Cancellation Pattern Over Year:** The frequency of cancellations increases each month, peaking in July and August, and then tends to decrease from September to December.
- **High Season Cancellations and ADR:** Both the number of cancellations and the ADR are notably high in July and August.

## Conclusions

The analysis of the hotel booking data yields several crucial insights:

- The city and resort hotels cater to distinct market segments, reflected in their booking ratios and seasonal trends.
- The summer months, particularly July and August, emerge as the high season for both hotel types, but they also bring the highest rates of cancellations, especially in city hotels.
- The ADR analysis indicates a correlation between high cancellations and higher rates, particularly noticeable in resort hotels during peak months.
- Market segment analysis reveals that the Online TA segment, despite being popular, faces a high rate of cancellations, highlighting an area for strategic focus and improvement.
- The "Groups" segment, particularly within the cancellation group, shows a trend of significantly longer lead times, suggesting a need for tailored strategies in managing group bookings.
