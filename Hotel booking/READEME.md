# Hotel Booking Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze a comprehensive dataset of hotel bookings for both a city hotel and a resort hotel. By examining various aspects of the booking data, we seek to uncover key trends and patterns in the hospitality industry.

This hotel booking dataset can help you explore those questions!

## Dataset Description
This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things.

## SQL Queries

The analysis phase encompassed a variety of queries to derive meaningful insights:

- **Continental Overview:** This query determined the number of continents, the number of countries in each continent, and their total populations.
- **Population Extremes:** This part identified the highest and lowest population figures for each continent.
- **Decadal Population Change:** Focused on countries like Russia, examining population decreases over the past decade.

## Key Findings
- **Population Distribution**: The Asian continent had the highest population in 2010, with significant contributions from China and India.
- **Population Increase**: A majority of countries (188 out of 212) experienced a population increase, with India recording the highest growth.
- **Population Decrease**: A total of 24 countries, mainly in Europe, observed a decrease in their population.
- **Population Rankings and Percentages**: This part of the analysis involved calculating and ranking countries based on their 2010 populations, as well as determining their percentages of the global population.

## Conclusions
1. The Asian continent, primarily driven by the populations of China and India, holds a commanding lead in global population numbers.
2. Most countries worldwide experienced population growth from 2000 to 2010, with India seeing the most significant increase.
3. A smaller group of countries, mainly in Europe, experienced population declines.
4. Russia stood out as a major country with a declining population trend throughout the decade
5. China held the highest population in Asia, while Niue had the lowest in Oceania.
